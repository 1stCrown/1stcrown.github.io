                <p>Orphan ➝Soldier ➝ Seeker ➝ Herrscher ➝ Guide of Humanity</p>
                <p>Born in Siberia, Bronya lost her parents during the Second Honkai War and was taken in by Cocolia's
                    orphanage, which secretly trained child soldiers.</p>
                <p>Trained as an assassin, she earned the title "Silver Wolf of the Urals" due to her exceptional
                    skills. </p>
                <p>After forming a deep bond with fellow orphan Seele, Bronya sought to understand the world and her
                    purpose, leading her to enroll at St. Freya Academy.</p>
                <p>Bronya inherited the Herrscher of Reason core from Welt Yang, gaining the ability to construct
                    objects and striving to use this power to save Seele.</p>
                <p>As the Herrscher of Truth, she embraced humanity's capacity for change, guiding others with wisdom
                    and compassion.</p>
                <p>“The only inevitable truth about humanity is that humanity’s truth will change inevitably.”</p>
